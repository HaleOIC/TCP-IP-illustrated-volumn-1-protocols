# TCP-IP-illustrated-volumn-1-protocols
This folder has contained some codes and notes for the classical textbook &lt;TCP/IP illustrated:volumn 1 protocols>, which is regarded as the best book for learning the TCP and IP protocols.

because the book's author has been passed away such a long time, so the generation of the book has not been renewed,

and the basic framework of the internet has not been much too changed. 

So the first generation is capable to solve almost all the questions and the details of the framework.

If you has interests, welcome to my another repository.

Thanks for watching!

For some reason, I may not have the opportunity to finish this repository all the notes, but the core part TCP

will be summarized and displayed.
