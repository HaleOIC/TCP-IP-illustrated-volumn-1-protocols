# TCP-IP-illustrated-volumn-1-protocols
This folder has contained some codes and notes for the classical textbook &lt;TCP/IP illustrated:volumn 1 protocols>, which is regarded as the best book for learning the TCP and IP protocols.

because the book's author has been passed away such a long time, so the generation of the book has not been renewed,

and the basic framework of the internet has not been too much changes in

So the first generation are capable to solve almost questions and details.
